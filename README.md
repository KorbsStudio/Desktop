 ## FAQ
Q. Windows says the setup file is a virus.
A. The Falixnodes Desktop program is just a web app and does not contain any viruses. Please click more info and click Run Anyway. I am still looking into this issue.

Q. How do I update this?!
A. When a new update is available, a button at the top should show up. It will say Update Available. When you click it, a new setup file will start downloading to your Downloads folder. Please wait until it is done downloading then close the software and setup. The setup file will overwrite files on the software and update files.

Q. The page isn't loading
A. Yes, this happens sometimes. Just reload the app by pressing Ctrl R / âŒ˜ R on your keyboard.

Q. What is this built on?
A. Just like Discord, this is built on Electron.  Electron is an open-source framework developed and maintained by GitHub. Electron allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using web technologies: It combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime. This makes it more easy for web developers to create apps for computers.
